This plugin allows shipping to multiple addresses.

== Description ==
When customers are shopping for multiple people, they can now choose to have the products delivered to different addresses instead of placing multiple orders. 

Ship to Multiple Addresses lets your customers:
Checkout once, but ship to many locations
Send any quantity of products to any number of addresses
Allow custom note for each product (optional)

Ship to Multiple Addresses lets you:
Include fixed handling fee (individually to each product) when delivering to multiple addresses OR Calculate the default delivery taxes of each product 
Add flat fee to the "this is a gift" option (optional)

How does the Ship to Multiple Addresses plugin work?

Ship to Multiple Addresses displays a notice in the cart asking clients if they want to ship products to different addresses (screenshot #3). 
If they chose this option, the plugin would include additional checkout fields for each product"s delivery address (see screenshot #4).

Ship to Multiple Addresses also lets your client set a different delivery address for any quantity of products from their order.

The plugin includes the different delivery addresses in the client"s confirmation emails and the order notification email to the shop admin.
